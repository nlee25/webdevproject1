  <h1>Best of the Arknights Soundtrack</h1>
  <p>Arknights, in my heart takes the place of the best mobile game there is. While its nature of being just 'a tower defense game' may put some off of it</p>
  <p>the beauty of its art, music and story more than makes up for its shortcomings as a game. That being said, the game itself is extremely entertaining. </p>
  <p>This is a small sample of my favorite songs from the game. Most are leitmotifs for characters.</p>

	<p> My personal favorite song, for my favorite operator, Nearl. The trailer Arknights made is an excellent blend of audio and visual work so its best to watch this. </p>
